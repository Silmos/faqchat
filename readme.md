# FAQChat

## 1. What is FAQChat?

 FAQChat is a chat addon for WoW Classic, which you can use to create your own triggers for buzzwords to respond automatically. Currently it works for whispers and guild chat only. This addon was made for my guild so you can respond to commands like !aq or !discord in guildchat.

## 2. Example

You have a text "I like cookies" and you want to respond to the buzzword "cookie". So just create a new buzzword with your text, mark the checkbox for whispers or/and guild chat and save it. Afterwards if someone mentions "cookie" in whisper or/and guild chat you automatically respond "I like cookies".

Attention: There is a checkbox if the buzzword should also respond to your own message with the buzzword. This can cause loops if you mention the buzzword in your message.

## 3. Commands

- /faq
- /faqc
- /faqchat
-> These commands all do the same, it just opens the option interface (Interface > Addons > FAQChat).
